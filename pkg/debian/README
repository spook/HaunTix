README file for Hauntix

After installing the package for the first time, 
you must create the initial database schema.

NOTE: This will *** WIPE OUT *** (erase, destroy, delete, nuke ) any 
existing "hauntix" database you may have.  You have been warned.

  # cd /usr/share/htx
  # mysql -u root -p -f < hauntix_create.sql 

When prompted, enter the database's root user password (not necessarily
the same as the system's root password.  The first time you do this, 
it's normal to get errors about can't drop a database and can't drop a user.

Now from the same directory, load in some test data:

  # mysql -u root -p -f < hauntix_test_data.sql 

Again when prompted, enter the database's root user password.


NEXT STEPS: Define your event, shows, tickets, etc.

Happy Haunting!
