Thank you for volunteering at the Haunted Mines!
Here are tickets you've earned by helping us as a head actor.
Note that you may receive multiple emails; check the pickup codes in 
each, they may be different, in which case you have even more tickets.
Stay Scary!
                          ---- o ----

To view and print your tickets, 
   * Go to the Haunted Mines website at http://HauntedMines.org 
   * Click "Buy Tickets Now"
   * Click "Enter Pickup Code"  
   * Enter your Pickup Code and email address.
Your tickets will be emailed to you as a PDF file.  You may also view and 
print the tickets right then.

                    Your Pickup Code is $pikCode

Keep this pickup code in a safe place; whoever has it can use these tickets.
Thanx for visiting the Haunted Mines - we look forward to scaring you!
