Boo!

This is the source code for the HaunTix ticketing system.
It's a point-of-sale and on-line (web) ticketing system,
plus an entry control system to scan the tickets at the
entry to the attraction.

I wrote it for use at my haunted attraction, the Haunted Mines,
after trying several commercial alternatives and not liking them.
I'm very happy with HaunTix -- a sentiment shared by our ticketing
agents for nearly a decade.

So, I'm putting it into the community as open source, but in it's present
state it is not ready for general use.  I hope to get it there some
day.  The main code works fine, but the packinging and setup
require lots of manual intervention and a good knowledge of Linux and SQL.

This system is not limited to haunted attractions.  It's a good general-purpose
point-of-sale system.  

Please note that at this time, this is not supported at all.
Thus... good luck!
